Problems:
1. A number can be broken into different contiguous sub-subsequence parts. Suppose, a number 3245 can be broken into parts like 3 2 4 5 32 24 45 324 245. And this number is a COLORFUL number, since product of every digit of a contiguous subsequence is different. Return 1 if COLORFUL, else 0. (colorful)
2. Largest Continuous Sequence Zero Sum (largestZeroArray)
