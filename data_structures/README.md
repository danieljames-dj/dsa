Data Structure in Programming: the different types
Definition: There are many definitions and my favorite one A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
Classification
There are plenty of ways in which Data Structures are classified. The basic classification is as follows:
Primitive Data Structures: These include Integer, Float, Character, Boolean, String.
Non-Primitive Data Structures: These can be further classified into Linear and Non-Linear Data Structures.

The non-primitive data structures can be classified as:
Array
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Tree
Graph
Hash Table

1–4 comes under Linear Data Structures and 5–7 comes under Non-Linear Data Structures. But actually it doesn't matter whether it's linear or non-linear. The best way to start learning Data Structures is to keep a checklist of the above 7 types and go deep into each one of them.
