Problems:
1. Print the triplets of an array which have sum = 0. (triplet-zero)
2. Given an array which has the digits of a non-negative integer. Add 1 to the integer. (add-one)
3. Find the contiguous subarray within an array, A of length N which has the largest sum. (MaxSumContiguousSubarray)
4. You are given an array of N integers, A1, A2 ,…, AN. Return maximum value of f(i, j) for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ N. f(i, j) is defined as |A[i] - A[j]| + |i - j|, where |x| denotes absolute value of x. (MaximumAbsoluteDifference)
5. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-zeroes-to-be-flipped-so-that-number-of-consecutive-1s-is-maximized/ (flip)
6. Given an integer A, generate a square matrix filled with elements from 1 to A2 in spiral order. (spiral-matrix)
7. Best time to buy stock (stock)
8. 4 key is not working in keyboard, convert into two numbers instead (Foregone)
9. Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100. (sumHundred)
