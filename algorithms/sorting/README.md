## Sorting algorithms

1. Selection sort

In selection sort, we will repeatedly find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and add it to the sorted part of the array.

2. Bubble sort

In bubble sort, we will repeatedly swap the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

3. Insertion sort

In insertion sort, we will iterate through the array n-1 times and after every i-th iteration, we will make sure first i+1 elements are sorted.

4. Merge sort

In merge sort, we will keep on dividing the array into two halves and then merge the sorted halves in sorted order.

5. Quick sort

In quick sort, we will select an element as pivot and partition the array depending on pivot and do the same procedure on both the partitions.

6. Heap sort

In heap sort, we will build a max heap, swap the maximum element with the end of the array and heapify the remaining array.
