Find Union
----------
There are n elements and all are disjoint. Implement two methods:
1. union(x, y): This will combine the two elements x & y.
2. find(x, y): This will check if two elements are connected.

Here are the problems:
1. Implement quick-find (Here, union() will be O(n) and find() will be O(1))
2. Implement quick-union (Here, union() will be O(n) and find() will be O(n))
